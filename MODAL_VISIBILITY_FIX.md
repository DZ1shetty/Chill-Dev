# üé® Modal Visibility & Animation Fix - Complete

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed Successfully

**Problem**: The "Add Safety Report" modal had poor text visibility - white/light text on white background made it nearly impossible to read.

**Solution**: Complete redesign with dark theme consistency and professional animations.

---

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Modal Background & Container
**Before**: 
- White background (`bg-white/95`)
- Light borders
- Poor contrast with text

**After**:
- Dark theme background (`bg-[#2D2D44]`)
- Consistent with app theme
- Better backdrop blur (`bg-black/60`)
- Smoother appearance with `animate-scaleIn`

### 2. Text Visibility Improvements

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Heading | `text-gray-900` (dark on white) | `text-white` (white on dark) ‚úÖ |
| Labels | `text-gray-700` | `text-gray-200` ‚úÖ |
| Body Text | `text-gray-800` | `text-gray-100` ‚úÖ |
| Description | `text-gray-500` | `text-gray-400` ‚úÖ |

**Buttons**:
- Cancel: Dark gray with hover effect

- Both have active state animations (`active:scale-95`)

### 5. Animation Enhancements

**New Animation**: `scaleIn`
```css
@keyframes scaleIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

**Animation Timing**:
- Modal entrance: 300ms with cubic-bezier easing

- Close button: Rotation effect on hover

### 6. Professional Touches
