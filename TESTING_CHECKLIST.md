# ✅ Testing Checklist - Police Station Feature

## 🎯 Quick Test (5 Minutes)

Your app is now running at: **http://localhost:3001/**

### Step-by-Step Testing Guide

---

## ✨ **Test 1: Basic Functionality** (Must Test!)

### Steps:
1. **Open the app** → http://localhost:3001/
2. **Login/Signup** (if not already logged in)
3. **Navigate to Map page** (should see Google Maps)
4. **Click anywhere on the map** (preferably in an urban area like Mumbai, Delhi, etc.)
5. **Modal should open** with "Add Safety Report"
6. **Select "Unsafe Area"** (red button on the right)
7. **Type a description:** "Testing police station feature"
8. **Click "Add Report"** button

### ✅ Expected Results:
1. **First toast:** "Report added successfully!" (green)
2. **Second toast** (appears after 1-2 seconds):
   ```
   🚔 Nearest Police Station
   ─────────────────────────
   [Police Station Name]
   📍 [Distance] away
   [Full Address]
   📞 [Phone Number] (if available)
   ```
3. Toast should display for **6 seconds**
4. Modal should close after submission

### ❌ If It Doesn't Work:
- **No toast appears?** → Check browser console (F12) for errors
- **"Google Maps API not loaded"?** → Verify `.env` file has correct API key
- **"No police stations found"?** → Try clicking in a different (more urban) location

---

## 🔍 **Test 2: Console Verification**

### Open Browser Console (F12):

**What to check:**
1. Press `F12` key
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for these logs when you submit an unsafe report:

**✅ Success Messages:**
```
Searching for nearest police station...
Police station found: [Name]
Distance: [meters] meters
```

**❌ Error Messages (these are OK, feature still works):**
```
Failed to find police station: [error]
No police stations found nearby
```

---

## 🧪 **Test 3: Different Scenarios**

### Scenario A: Urban Area (Should Work)
**Location:** Click on major cities
- Mumbai (19.076, 72.877)
- Delhi (28.644, 77.216)
- Bangalore (12.971, 77.594)

**Expected:** Police station info appears

---

### Scenario B: Remote Area (Should Fail Gracefully)
**Location:** Click on ocean, forest, or rural area

**Expected:** 
- Report saves successfully
- Toast: "⚠️ Report saved but police notification failed"

---

### Scenario C: Safe Report (Should Skip)
**Steps:**
1. Click on map
2. Select **"Safe Area"** (green button)
3. Add description
4. Submit

**Expected:** 
- Only "Report added successfully!" toast
- NO police station info (feature only for unsafe reports)

---

## 🎨 **Visual Checks**

### Toast Notification Should Have:
- ✅ Blue police icon (🚔) at the top
- ✅ Bold police station name
- ✅ Distance with location icon (📍)
- ✅ Full address in smaller gray text
- ✅ Phone number with phone icon (📞) - if available
- ✅ Clean, professional styling
- ✅ Stays visible for 6 seconds

---

## 🔧 **Developer Testing**

### Check the Code is Running:

**1. Open Console and Run:**
```javascript
// Check if Google Maps is loaded
console.log(window.google?.maps ? '✅ Google Maps Loaded' : '❌ Not Loaded');

// Check if Places API is available
console.log(window.google?.maps?.places ? '✅ Places API Ready' : '❌ Not Available');
```

**2. Test the Function Directly:**
```javascript
// Import the function (in browser console, this won't work, but you can check in code)
// Open src/utils/mapUtils.ts and verify the function exists
```

---

## 📊 **Success Indicators**

### ✅ Feature is Working If:
- [x] Report saves to database
- [x] Toast notification appears after unsafe report
- [x] Police station name is displayed
- [x] Distance is shown (e.g., "1.2km" or "450m")
- [x] Address is visible
- [x] Phone number shows (if available)
- [x] No console errors (or only minor warnings)

### ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue 1: "Google Maps API not loaded"**
- **Check:** Open `.env` file
- **Verify:** `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **Fix:** Restart dev server after changing .env

**Issue 2: "Places API not enabled"**
- **Check:** Google Cloud Console
- **Fix:** Enable "Places API" in APIs & Services
- **Link:** https://console.cloud.google.com/

**Issue 3: "No police stations found"**
- **Reason:** Remote location or limited API quota
- **Fix:** Test in urban area (Mumbai, Delhi, etc.)

**Issue 4: Phone number not showing**
- **Status:** This is NORMAL
- **Reason:** Not all police stations have phone data
- **Solution:** Feature works correctly, phone is optional

## 🚨 **Emergency Checks**

### If Nothing Works:

cat .env
```
Should show: `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**2. Check API Key in Google Cloud:**
- Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/

- Verify API key is not restricted

**3. Check Build:**
```powershell
npm run build
```
Should complete without errors

**4. Clear Cache:**
- Close browser
- Clear all browser cache
- Restart dev server
- Try again
