- Lasts ~2 seconds

## 🔍 **WHAT TO CHECK IF IT DOESN'T WORK**

### **Option 1: Check Browser Console**
1. Press **F12** key (or right-click → Inspect)
2. Click **"Console"** tab
3. Look for messages:

**✅ Good messages:**
```
Searching for nearest police station...
Police station found: [name]
```

**❌ Error messages:**
```
Google Maps API not loaded
Places API not enabled
No police stations found nearby
```

### **Option 2: Check Network Tab**
1. Press **F12**
2. Click **"Network"** tab
3. Submit the unsafe report
4. Look for requests to Google Places API
5. Check if they succeed (status 200)

---

## 🎥 **SCREENSHOT CHECKLIST**

Take these screenshots for your demo/presentation:

1. **Before:** Map view with marker
2. **Modal:** Report form with "Unsafe Area" selected
3. **Toast:** The police station notification (THIS IS THE MONEY SHOT!)
4. **Console:** Success messages (optional, for technical demo)

---

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: Only ONE toast appears**
**Fix:** 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you clicked on an urban area (not ocean/forest)
- Make sure Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

### **Problem: "No police stations found"**
**Fix:**
- Try clicking on a different location (more urban)
- Test with coordinates: 19.076, 72.877 (Mumbai)
- This is normal for remote areas

### **Problem: "Google Maps API not loaded"**
**Fix:**
- Restart dev server: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`
- Check `.env` file has the API key
- Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+F5`

### **Problem: Phone number not showing**
**Status:** ✅ **THIS IS NORMAL**
- Not all police stations have phone data in Google's database
- The feature is working correctly
- Phone is an optional field
